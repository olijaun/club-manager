# club-manager

Management software for small clubs like our http://www.loscaracoles.ch

Let's see where it leads. For now I'm using it to test some new stuff like event sourcing and springboot.

## Design Goals

- Components are event sourced
- Business modules can be used independently (e.g. person module may be used without member module)
- Business modules (identity, member, person) have no code dependencies between them (only dependencies to club-manager-commons* and club-manager-eventstore-iface modules are allowed)
- Apart from club-manager-springboot-app there must be no dependencies on springboot

## Notes

- For the time being the REST resource classes also implement the application services
- REST Resources use jax-rs. In the future it would be nice to allow for other implementations
- Authentication is done using JWT Bearer Tokens
- A "classic eventstore" is implemented on top of akka persistence. This might seam ridiculous ;-) I just wanted to make what I call a "classic" event sourced DDD application and not implement a event store by myself. At a later stage I might change to a "reactive" implementation Ã  la lagom framework and then akka might make sense again.
- I started with eventstore by Greg Young but I wanted to run my software on a raspberry and there is no version for ARM as far as I know.

## Setup

postgres:
